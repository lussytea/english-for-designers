TOP 5 things I learned this semester:

1. I made steps to summarize me as a brand, my work. I finally wrote my CV! I am not standing „in front of empty canvas“, which is everytime the hardest part.
2. I find out the importance of good writting. It is not only about designing!
3. I know more voice, tone & style.
4. Perhaps for the first time in my life I had English lessons we learned things that I will use very soon (practically immediately). Sometimes it was difficult for me, but It totally challenged me! 
5. I discovered a small piece of the Github universe and I created something in it. I am really proud of myself! :D
