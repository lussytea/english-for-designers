# Voice & Tone

Creating a voice, tone and style guide helps me to act and speak consistently - through time and across all communication channels. It helps also an audience to understand me and create a relationship with me (and my work). Following that strengthened trust in me. Because who do we feel more? The one who behaves our every meeting differently and changes their opinion every time? Or the one who has their own character and is authentic? 


## Voice

Voice is how I act, how my character is.

* I am #honest and casual. But building credibility.
* I’m taking it easy! But I'm not indifferent. 
* I am proud of what I do, but always humble. Never conceited.
* Straight to the point! I can express myself easily. I simplify it if it is possible. But I'm not afraid „to fly away“ for a while sometimes, if it suits. 
* I am alive, enthusiastic, I am not afraid to show feelings. But never affected. I'm staying authentic.
* I am kind and playful. But not childish. 
* I am using humor when it comes naturally. Not trying to be funny by force. Make fun of yourself, but never humiliate yourself.

## Tone

My tone is how I speak, how I use my voice in different situations. It is similar like face-to-face communication in real life. We use the tone according to who we’re talking to and what we’re talking about, but our personality (voice) remains the same. 

Regardless of formality level
- be empathic, try to feel the situation, and respond accordingly.
- go straight to the point! Express it easily.
- stay honest and authentic.
- use humor when it comes naturally, not try to be funny by force. 
- be creative! be free to use movie quotes, original metaphor, verse, etc.
- ask questions, open topics, be mysterious sometimes.


## Style


* Use active voice, instead of passive voice.
* Use plain English.
* Write positively, instead of negatively.

* Shorten the words, if it is possible.
* Use a consistent title hierarchy. Use strong headlines.
* Use paragraphs to segment the text.
* Use abbreviations and acronyms in this way:
        * First use: National Gallery Prague (NGP) 
        * Second use: NGP
