Find out more [about me](https://lussytea.github.io/english-for-designers/03-aboutness/) or continue or are you interested in what we did on the course? 

To warm up we played with [characters](https://lussytea.github.io/english-for-designers/01-character-description/)! A typo can be fun, I swear! Then we try to make [impression](https://lussytea.github.io/english-for-designers/02-impression/) on our classmates via a couple of selected works. Later on, we focused on one specific project we developed in the [case study](https://lussytea.github.io/english-for-designers/03-aboutness/case-study.html). I finally summarized my [experience](https://lussytea.github.io/english-for-designers/04-experience/) in the resume! Yeah! Finally, we defined our [voice & Tone](https://lussytea.github.io/english-for-designers/05-voice-tone/) and shared our [design story](https://lussytea.github.io/english-for-designers/06-storytelling/).

And what did I take from the course? Here is my TOP 5 [takeaways](https://lussytea.github.io/english-for-designers/07-takeaways/)!
