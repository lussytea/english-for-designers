# Dezi Dezi Koleda

##### The story began, when Marianna, the head of the organization team of the Deziluze Festival, texted me on FB Messenger:

![mari-chat1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/79570985/142956340-b64fe910-5e28-4959-ab70-5fe80944b5d9.png)

##### BUT I had deactivated Facebook at that time so I didn't answer. So she texted me on Messenger again:

##### BUT my Facebook was still deactivated so I still didn’t answer. So she called me: 

### *M: Hey Lucy! Why are you ignoring me? :( I wrote you on Messenger many times! :(

###  *L: OH NO, Mari! I am very sorry! But don't take it personally, it was not intentional! I deactivated my Facebook but maybe I forgot to deactivate Facebook Messenger. However I am not using it right now. Tell me, what did you write me there?*

### To project the visual style of the festival (colors, motives, typography, and drawing style).

##### I began to think about it and lay the important question to myself: WHAT DOES THE CHRISTMAS MEAN TO ME? WHAT'S TYPICAL FOR THE (CZECH) CHRISTMAS? 
##### And then...
### ...the magic happened! My phone tinkled with the reminder! 
##### **my mother asked me that time every day what I want for Christmas, and I forgot every day to write it to her so I had to create a reminder.*

# HEUREEEEEEEEEEEEKAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA! 
### This is it! The children's letters to Baby Jesus!

##### So I made one too.

##### And than...

##### ...I have created the Christmas version of the iconic festival deer.

##### And I have stood him in front of the letter.

##### The reactions were varied. Everyone reacted with a heart! Somebody wrote "Super!". And someone also "As a stand-alone artwork perfect, but functionally I thought there would be band names and such..."

##### ...GOOD POINT! But question is, *is it neccesary to do it always the same way?*

##### I did the similar with the performers. Each of them has own letter. Each of them was a wish of different imaginary child.

##### After that I set in motion a short surreal melancholic release animation with...

##### ...hand cut snowflakes!

##### This project is still running, but current reviews are fabulous. And more are coming. There are some examples:

### But children, this fairy tail has no happy end. An ugly state of emergency has arrived and the event must be moved. But even that happens!

# MERRY CHRISTMAS! And see you maybe sometimes in Příbram!
