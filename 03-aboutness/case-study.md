# Dezi Dezi Koleda

Once upon a time:

The story began when Marianna, the head of organization team of Deziluze Festival, wrote me:

![mari-chat1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/79570985/142790559-d5f70208-f9c2-4e76-8427-6b2e40307238.png)

And I didn’t have Facebook at that time so I didn’t answer. So she wrote me again:

![mari-chat2-1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/79570985/142791170-6b5fa54b-de49-452e-b764-52fa7f9e4bde.png)


And I still didn’t have Facebook so I didn’t answer again. 

So she called me and said: 

M: Hey Lucy, why are you ignoring me? I wrote you on messenger many times! :(((
L: Ooooh Mari! I am sorry, I deactivated my Facebook but maybe I forgot to deactivate messenger, but I am not using it. So trust me! I am not ignoring you! Tell me, what did you wrote me?

THE TASK: 

Graphics for Christmas event of Deziluze Festival

Date: 3.12.2021
Place: Pojistka Club, Příbram 
Interprets: Young Havel, Pokoj 25, Cringe Prince, Meli, Frain Breeze, Anhum

Keywords:
#christmas #cheesy

A I add to myself: 

To project the visual style of the festival ((sample))
To use brand colors ((sample brand colors))

I began tu thinking about it and lay the important question to myself: WHAT DOES THE CHRISTMAS MEAN TO ME? WHATS TYPICAL FOR THE CZECH CHRISTMAS? 

…and then the magic happened! My phone tinkled with the rimender!:

* my mother asked me everyday what I want for Christmas, and I everyday forgot to wrote to her so I had to make I reminder.

HEUREEEEKAAAAAA! This is it! The children letters to Baby Jesus!

(((OBRÁZKY DOPISŮ DĚTÍ)))

So I made some of the letters and used them for example for FB event cover and release posts of interprets. I'll probably use them somewhere else, but I'm not done yet.

Vzbudilo to vlno kontroverzních reakcí - od sodíkových reakcí, přes pozitivní komentáře po „Jako umělecké dílo dobrý….“

Than I create the Christmas version of the iconic of the Deer mascot. (((OBRÁZEK JELEN BEFORE / AFTER))

And the short melancholic surrealistic release animation with the hand cut snowflakes!

(((FOTKA NEBO VIDEO VLOČEK))

(((Animace))))
