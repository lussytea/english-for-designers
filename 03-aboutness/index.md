## My Story

![lussy_fotka_web](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/79570985/149385310-b2849eae-1e2b-4506-bff7-56736bceabac.jpg)

We perceive the world through images. So is it probably a good way how to communicate with each other, right? That's the reason I am a graphic designer.

I see every brand, logo, book, magazine, poster, animation, and everything from the visual world, as a being. How to dress this person to attract attention? How to keep eye contact? How to speak for him so that others listen to him, understand and answer him? How to make others want to be friends with him and be proud of it?

Due to my background in production design, I am often thinking about graphics as a part of space. I enjoy applied graphics on the walls, used in projections and installations, in fashion, in print. I am often bringing life and authenticity into the clear graphics through using traditional media, hand drawing, and writing. 

I live in Prague, the city of hundred spires, but you maybe know it better as the place, where “I enjoyed the great party, man!”.  I am in love with exploring the cultural events of all kinds, finding inspiration for life in movies and serials, gossiping and deep talking with friends, drawing, painting, lettering, building scenographic construction, and creating other handmade stuff, where you can go dirty, riding the horse, talking about going to yoga and gym, and sometimes actually going there.
