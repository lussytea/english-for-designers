# Anežka = Young National Gallery or *The missing piece*.

## Summary

Creating a communication style of the potentially newly born art and cultural platform Anežka. A concept of a young generation art scene under the auspices of the prestigious state National Gallery in Prague (NGP). The aim is to create a distinctive visual and linguistic style, which would represent it in the market among the competition. I will try to find a way to visually connect with NGP. At the same time, however, and above all, the way of sufficient differentiation of these two institutes. I would like people to know clearly that they are communicating with Anežka and entering her territory.

## Keywords

- **#visual style, #visual identity** 
    - A unified visual style is one of the most important means of communication for any institution. It supports and complements its modern image,shows its stability, raises awareness of the existence, reflects its qualities. The basis of the unified visual style of the company consists of the following four elements: #logo, #typography, #color, #visual style.


- **#brand**
    - As David Ogilvy said, *"Brand is what you have left when your factory burns down."*

- **#graphic design**
- **#communication, #marketing**
- **#culture #art #artgallery, #culture events**

## Key Points

**1/ Background/importance of topic:** 

The point zero is the fact, we got the space for a cafe in The Convent of St. Agnes in Prague, which is currently under the proper National Gallery. We are connected with curators and we plan to build a cafe with a special cultural substance. In my Bachelor thesis, I am creating a potential situation, where all these activities run under the official auspices of the National Gallery in Prague (NGP) and the unified name Anežka. 

**2/ Purpose/hypothesis (thesis or statement of problem):** 

Anežka speaks for the young artistic generation, whose voice the National Gallery lacks. In addition, the current market lacks state institutions of this type. 

**3/ Research — design/methodology/approach including procedures/data/observations:** 

The official communication concept of NGP, as introduced in 2018 by Aleš Najbrt, is called Space for Art. According to this philosophy, all communication, as with most other world-known galleries, is running. It creates a neutral environment, creating imaginary bare frames for art. The question I want to address in my work is: can institutions of this type use a unique linguistic and visual style in which it represents itself?

In the theoretical part, I will try to create an insight into the visual and linguistic style of similar institutions. In a separate chapter, I will focus on NGP. Here I would like to find an element connecting the NGP with the sister institution Anežka and define how the paths will be different. Included Anežka’s completely autonomous communication. 

In the practical part I will demonstrate the outputs with examples in the exterior, interior and digital world.

**4/ Findings (highlight outcome of research):**

**5/ Conclusions (significance/success of study to theory/practical/society):**

As mentioned, I hope in the creation a distinctive visual and linguistic style of this young cultural institution, who will speak in a fresh voice to the people and entice/ attract them to discover it.
