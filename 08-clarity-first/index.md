# Anežka = Young National Gallery or *The missing piece*.

## Summary

Creating a communication style of the potentially newly born art and cultural platform Anežka. A concept of a young generation art scene under the auspices of the prestigious state National Gallery in Prague (NGP). The aim is to create a distinctive visual and linguistic style, which would represent it in the market among the competition. I will try to find a way to visually connect with NGP. At the same time, however, and above all, the way of sufficient differentiation of these two institutes. I would like people to know clearly that they are communicating with Anežka and entering her territory.
