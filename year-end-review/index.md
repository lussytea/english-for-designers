# Year End Review

1) What did you like most about this course?

Mmm you know, for me were english classes always little bit annoying... But these classes were connected with the actual stuff I do, and it was f*cking great!! <3 It pushed me to do things I wanted to do long time, and...on top of that.. in English! 
Moreover, I wasn't just learning english, but also many more new, important and interisting things in the field and use very soon (practically immediately). ..thanks!)
