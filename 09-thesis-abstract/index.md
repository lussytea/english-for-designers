# ANEŽKA - YOUNG NATIONAL GALLERY PRAGUE / Visual-communication concept of a cultural institution

by Lucie L. Tyc

## Abstract

The bachelor's thesis presents the concept of the Anežka project, a young art scene under the
auspices of the National Gallery Prague (= Mladá Národní galerie Praha / Young National Gallery
Prague), which unites and presents various types of visual activity of young artists and designers.
The National Gallery Prague is the patron and auspices in this relationship, but Anežka operates
autonomously. The work presents a visual solution that will clearly demonstrate the connection with
the National Gallery Prague, but at the same time the path of their mutual differentiation. The goal
is to bring to the cultural market a self-confident brand with a defined philosophy, created by
character and a unique communication and visual style.
